## ðŸŽ› Virtual Drag & Drop with Hand Tracking (OpenCV + CVZone)
## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project is a Computer Vision-based virtual drag & drop application that allows users to move objects on the screen simply by hand movements in front of the camera, without the need for a mouse or other physical input devices. By utilizing OpenCV for image processing, CVZone HandTrackingModule for hand detection, and Mediapipe for tracking key points (landmarks) on the hand, this system is able to recognize finger positions in real-time.

##ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

Real-Time Hand Tracking using your laptop/PC camera.

Pinch-to-Grab Gesture: Move objects by pinching your thumb and index finger.

Multi-Object Drag & Drop: Multiple objects can be moved independently.

Smooth Motion: Smoother object movement with a smoothing system.

Transparent Labels & Colors: Each object has a label and a semi-transparent visual effect.

Easy Interaction: Simply use hand gestures in front of the camera.
